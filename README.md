# FN-NewsFeed
For this week's project, we decided to build a newsfeed site.
The news articles in the feed are taken from two api's and shown together in the newsfeed.
our web site basiclly speaks for it self, we get new from 2 api's and combine it into 2 sections, one for the main news and the other for the side news.
and each news has a button that takes us to the source of that article if user needed that.
